Class containment diagram for the given code to help you visualize it:

The diagram would consist of two boxes, one for each class (question and question_paper).

The question class box would contain its attributes (with the private access specifier symbol -:

- __question
- __answer
- __marks
And its methods (with the public access specifier symbol +):

+ __init__(ques, ans, mar)
+ get_question()
+ get_answer()
+ get_marks()
+ set_question(value)
+ set_answer(value)
+ set_marks(value)
The question_paper class box would contain its attributes (with the private access specifier symbol -_:

- __no_of_questions
- __questions
- __total_marks
And its methods (with the public access specifier symbol +):

+ __init__(no_of_questions)
+ get_question(question_number)
+ get_total_marks()
+ create_question()
To represent the containment relationship, draw a line with a diamond shape on one end, connecting the two class boxes. The diamond shape should be on the question_paper class box side, pointing towards the question class box. This indicates that the question_paper class contains objects of the question class.

The containment relationship is represented by the list attribute __questions in the question_paper class, which holds multiple question objects.
